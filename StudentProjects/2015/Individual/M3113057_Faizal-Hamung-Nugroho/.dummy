	Along the shore the cloud waves break,
    The twin suns sink behind the lake,
    The shadows lengthen

        In Carcosa.

    Strange is the night where black stars rise,
    And strange moons circle through the skies,
    But stranger still is

        Lost Carcosa.

    Songs that the Hyades shall sing,
    Where flap the tatters of the King,
    Must die unheard in

        Dim Carcosa.

    Song of my soul, my voice is dead,
    Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
    Shall dry and die in

        Lost Carcosa.
